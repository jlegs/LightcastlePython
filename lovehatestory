If you're like most people, at some point in your life you've probably had a huge argument with someone close to you.
Whether it was with a parent, sibling, close friend or significant other, experts say it's just a fact of life. So how do you navigate those times when you and your loved ones don't exactly see eye-to-eye? Bloom took time with area psychologists to find out how to get through the not-so-fun times.

According to Maria Whitmore, a psychologist at CPS, realizing that you're going to have difficult times in any relationship is one way to help be more prepared for when the relationship is strained. Once hard times come, you won't be surprised and can deal with problems as they arise, she said.



I think sometimes it might depend on what type of relationship youre talking about and what the issues are. Sometimes ita amatter of just taking a break and getting a littls pace. Sometimes if its a good friend we spend too much together and rubbing on each others nerves. You can do that in families too. Just take a break and come back and communicate about what the issues are and sort of let each side present their ...
 
I think one rule you can use is if you’re feeling very very upset and very aroused it probably is best to take some kind of a break and come back to it when youre a little bit leveled off and cna think about it a little more clearly.


Take a break/breather ---
Does depend on the situation. And who the relatinoship is with. And a break can be five minutes or a break can be a week. So it depends a little bit.

We kind of joke sometimes as our anger or our emtions increase our IQ tends to drop a few points. I fyou can take a break and let the emtions come own you can probably think a littl emore and take time to process.

I think the other sort of broad one would be to try to whenever you can focus on the postiive. So weven when there are issues trying to focus on the positive and acknowledge the positive. Keeps the balance.

Exmaples: like with a spouse if you’re having tension even just acknowledge hey i appreicted yesterday when you helped with the dishes.
Even as simple as bringing the subject up and being appreciative for that.
 
Those are kind of the basics. Making sure you’re communicating.
 
Understanding how they communicate. Trying to take the other persons perspective a little bit understanding where they’re coming from. Ideally both parties would be abel to presrent their concerns and get their concerns on the table.
 
A lot of times we have a tendency to assume. This person has a problem with me because xyz when really the root issue is completly differnt. People need to feel like they’re being heard some times.
 
Sometimes it’s just getting it out. We do get in trouble sometimes when we keep things in. And then wehn you do let it out it sort of blows up.
 
Thats another good tip as sooon as you start to see something come up, try to deal with it. So getting ...
 
Even trivial things can snowball into greater issues.
 
Like day 1 its you didnt do the dishes and that annoyed me. And five days later its you didnt do the dishes and you were rude to me and i hate you.
 
Smaller problems are typically easier to deal with than compounded problem.
 
Then you have to deal with all the emotions that is attached to.
 





a lot of people go into relationships with a pretty idealistic attitide that nothing negative will ever happen.
It’s a false assumption,.
And i think the other false assumption that goes along with that is that if somethign bad does happen that it probably breaks the relationship. Somewhere in between those two is probably the reality.

i guess it has to be past a romantic period
 
 
Once the other person becomes significant to you, you can be hurt by them and you can worry about the loss of them and it puts you in kind of jeopardy i guess (emotionally).
 
Close relationships in families have a history. They kind of depend on the role that the child gets in the family and the rules about the family in the family as to whether they tolerate any kinds of disputes or whether they freely argue with each other and then make up. It really depends a lot on the family.
And i think thats what people carry into their romantic relatiohsips. You never marry or make a commited relationsyhip with just a person. You commit to their family.
 
It becomes a matter of negotiation. If people can sort of process their relationship and talk about it and be able to reflect on, lets say they have an argument and theyre feeling pouting or theyre feeling threatened or whatever. If they can come back together and talk about that e vent and how they flet they can begin to negotiate how its going to be in the future.
[se as learning opportunities if they can do that. ]
An awful lot of people will have disputes and walk away from them and bury them or deny them and then they come back an they do the same thing over again.
 
The old saying of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. A lot of couples especially make the same argument over and over again - doesn’t matter what they rearguig about whether its leaving the cap of the toothpaste tube or over the kids or the car= they do it the same way.
 
When issues come up
Don’t try to settle an argument while you’re emotionally aroused. But of course some people just walk away and stay away. He walks off to the bar she walks off and talks to her mother. That really doesn’t do the job of renegotiating their relationship.
 
Time away can depend on the people. So much of this depends on the people that its hard to generalize.
Generally when we work with couples, the main thing we’re trying to do is get them to communicate some of their more tender emotions. Usually when you have a dispute yorue going to get anger or threat or something like that. But the tender emotions such as being injured or feeling hurt or worried are not communicated. They’re kind of buried. We try to get them to do their fighting in a different way.
 
Journaling about it not tool he has found success with. Most people don’t journal. Most people are just left with a sort of reverberating feelings they walk away with. And they’re not going t be able to process al that objectively.
 
Tools he recommends, you know its kind of hard to say what the
 
They really have to be able to get past the content of the argument and process the way in which they have been arguing and what the result emotionally hs been for them.
Because you know what will happen, if they stay at the content level they’ll remember what the other person said and then they’ll use that in a later conversation. Its usually in a kind of accusatory conversation. You have to get beyond that and see what people are trying to accomplish when they are arguing (the stuff behind the words).
 
And people have different personality styles so some people have
One of the things we talk about in our classes some people have a style where they just want to make things go away make things pelaseant do everything they can to keep conflict down where some people are normally more assertive aggressive and some other people want to vanish.
 
If they can come to understand the other persons general style and say if one person - this is usually the woman - if she is really trying to make things nice and make things go away and keep the conflict down either he is more of a moving away person or moving toward a kind of person, they need to understand how the other works.
You know yourself when you’re in the midst of an argument you just want to win and other times you might just want to hurt.

I think that’s just part of life so it is going to happen. Everybody’ sgoing to have a time in a relationshp when things arent so good so i dont think you can spend a whol elot of time preparing for that. So just know its a possibilty and deal with it when it happens.
