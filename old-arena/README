** Source
- The upstream version of the game can be found here [fn:1]. For now, this is my fork. [fn:2]

** Installation
- As of right now (Wed Sep 26 12:35:12 EDT 2012), you can run "python2 rpg.py" to get a random result.
*** TODO Test webserver.py and webapp.py

** Known Bugs
- Wed Sep 26 12:36:57 EDT 2012: When running rpg.py, player always wins, presumably due to an algorithmic error.

----edit by @jlegs -- this isn't actually a bug, it's just me testing things. The rat's hp is low enough that the player kills it in 1 or 2 hits.


* Changelog
- Wed Sep 26 12:00:03 EDT 2012: Created README and added some general information about the game.
- Wed Sep 26 12:50:42 EDT 2012: Edited some comments and cleaned up SOME syntax in rpg.py.
