A Basic Django ARENA FIGHTER
===============

Cue the battle music. Set up your favorite classes. It's time for the lousiest web RPG to hit the Internet since I was in high school.


Really, I don't have install docs because this is more of a personal project, and for learningz.

I'm using Postgres (yay Postgres!). Everything is pretty minimal right now. Clone and run locally to enjoy! (almost)
