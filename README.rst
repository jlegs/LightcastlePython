A Basic Django ARENA FIGHTER
===============

Cue the battle music. Set up your favorite classes. It's time for the lousiest web RPG to hit the Internet since I was in high school.


Really, I don't have install docs because this is more of a personal project, and for learningz.

I'm using Postgres (yay Postgres!). Everything is pretty minimal right now. Clone and run locally to enjoy! (almost)
^ SCRATCH THAT
I got tired of Postgres and changed it to MySQL. If you want to use Postgres, just change the appropriate settings. The dependency is still in requirements.txt.


If you want to play the game as a command line version, go to the old-arena directory and run "python rpg.py". This is the basic
arena fighter before porting it to Django. This will not be updated.
