write python restful server

for simple multiplayer game

battle game.

OBJECTS ARE:
player, armor and weapon

so each should be restful thing. can add player, delete, update. same with armor and weapons.

can also associate piece of armor or weapon with a player. When you call get on a player, you'll not only get back player, but the armor and weapons for that player.

can issue new attack. (maybe it's a strike. that's another type of model [object].)

will need some way to connect to the server - will have to tell the client what the address of the server. doesnt have to handle pairing people up, just assumes two people want to connect. 

fires itself up each time you make request -- so how do you write web application in python. 
so you go to localhost you want python to respond on that port (80?)


have set of five weapons and set of five armortypes, they should all have like interesting descriptions and certain level of hit multiplier

can equip then battle


if not click based will have to deal with fact that 

whereas if you just sit there and throw hits then when you try and hit after you're dead it just responds with 'dead' or whatever

cuz dont know when other person's turn is. 

server code chunk in one dir
and client code chunk in another dir

doesnt even have to be interactive, can just wait then strike then strike.
